<h1>Isaiah Polite</h1>

<p>My name is Isaiah Polite and I am from Atlanta, Georgia. I came to the J-School in order to improve my technical ability in certain skill areas, work on large scale projects, and furthering my progress in my future aspirations.</p>
  
<p>In my free time I enjoy watching bad reality television, cooking, dancing, and trying to stay up to date on the fashion world. I'm thankful for the oppertunity to have been able to attend the J-School and I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge over the length of this course. Thank you for reading my short introduction.</p>
